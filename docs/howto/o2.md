# Control Omega LED from WEB

### Prerequisites

- Configured and [connected](/#connecting-a-new-device) Omega2 board.

### Code

- Open the [control.py](https://github.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python/blob/master/control.py) sample file.
- Replace `__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__` with the device token from the [Device](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page.
- Run `python led.py`. A new `Omega LED` variable should appear on the [Device](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page.
- Open the [Control Panels](https://cloud4rpi.io/control-panels/) page and add a new control panel.
- Add a new **Switch** widget and choose the newly added `Omega LED` variable.

You can now switch the onboard LED state using this widget.


# Control Expansion Board RGB LED from WEB

## Prerequisites

- Configured and [connected](/#connecting-a-new-device) Omega2 board.
- Expansion Board

### Code

<!-- MERGE THE EXAMPLES !!! -->

- Open the [led.py](https://github.com/cloud4rpi/cloud4rpi-omega2-python/blob/master/led.py) sample file.
- Replace `__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__` with the device token from the from the [Device](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page.
- Run `python control.py`. Three new variables should appear on the [Device](https://cloud4rpi.io/devices) page: `RGB LED - Red`, `RGB LED - Green` and `RGB LED - Blue`.
- Open the [Control Panels](https://cloud4rpi.io/control-panels/) page and add a new control panel.
- Add a **Switch** widget for each variable.

You can now change the RGB LED color using these widgets.


# Secure your MQTT connection

Cloud4RPi supports the TLS-enabled MQTTs protocol. If your task requires an encrypted data transfer, follow the steps below:

1. Install a package that provides the CA certificates for SSL and TLS protocols:

   ```sh
   opkg update && opkg install ca-certificates
   ```

2. Enable TLS by changing the `cloud4rpi.connect()` method call as follows:

    ```python
    device = cloud4rpi.connect(DEVICE_TOKEN, tls_config={'ca_certs': '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'})
    ```

    The `tls_config` dictionary holds parameters for the Paho MQTT's [tls_set()](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python#tls_set) function.
